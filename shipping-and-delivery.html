    <h1>Shipping and Delivery Policy</h1>

    <p>At <strong>DataCortex IQ (OPC) PVT LTD</strong> ("we," "us," "our"), we strive to deliver services promptly and ensure a seamless experience for our clients. Please read this Shipping and Delivery Policy carefully as it outlines important information about the delivery of our services and products.</p>

    <h2>1. Delivery Methods</h2>
    <p>All services provided by DataCortex are digital in nature and are delivered through electronic means. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud-based platforms and integrations.</li>
      <li>Email delivery of project files, reports, and deliverables.</li>
      <li>Direct access to cloud environments for ongoing services such as AI models or machine learning tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Delivery Timeline</h2>
    <p>Our service delivery timelines vary depending on the scope of the project. Generally, you can expect the following timelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial Project Setup:</strong> 3-5 business days after purchase confirmation.</li>
      <li><strong>Full Project Delivery:</strong> Depending on the complexity, projects are delivered within 2-8 weeks after project initiation.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscription Services:</strong> Ongoing services such as cloud monitoring, support, and access to tools are provided immediately upon completion of initial setup.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These timelines are estimates and may vary based on project complexity and client requirements. We will keep you informed of any changes or delays in the delivery schedule.</p>

    <h2>3. Shipping Fees</h2>
    <p>Since all services are delivered electronically, there are no shipping fees associated with the delivery of our services or digital products.</p>
